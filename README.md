# Data Analysis and Mathematics Exercises Repository 

This repository contains a series of mathematics and data analysis exercises that I have completed as part of my coursework.
## Repository Structure 

The repository is divided into different folders, each representing a specific homework assignment or a group of related exercises. Each folder contains:

- The main code file(s) for each exercise or problem.
- A brief description or explanation of the problem being solved or the concept being demonstrated.
- A pdf of the results of each exercise

## Contents

The problems solved and concepts explored in this repository span a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Matrix operations and transformations
- Numerical methods and algorithms
- Calculus and differential equations
- Complex number manipulation
- Statistical analysis and data visualization
- Bessel functions, elliptic integrals, and other special mathematical functions

These topics are not only essential for deepening mathematical understanding, but they are also highly applicable to practical data analysis tasks.

## Usage 

To replicate the results of any exercise, navigate to the corresponding folder, and run the main code file(s) following the instructions included in each folder.
